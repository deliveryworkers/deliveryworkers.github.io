On __March 10, 2021__, the lawyer of  “Ziyang” (pseudonym), who was among those arrested together with Mengzhu, was able to successfully book a meeting with her, but was then told that her case was still under review and the meeting had to be canceled.

Around __Feb.23/24 2021__, Mengzhu issued a warning in delivery workers’ Wechat groups that he might be in trouble; and he was arrested if no one heard from him on Wechat in the near future.

On __Feb. 21 2021__,  Mengzhu posted on his Weibo page saying that, after the first video clip got censored, he reedited it and reposted a different version.
