On February 25, 2021, a former food delivery worker and labor organizer who goes by the name of “Mengzhu” was detained by the Beijing police for organizing his fellow delivery workers. Mengzhu’s real name is Chen Guojiang, and had recently worked as a delivery worker before setting up mutual aid networks to support delivery workers. He was charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, a standard bogus charge regularly levelled against activists, on April 2, 2021, while two of his fellow delivery workers Ma Rong and Yu Ziyang remained detained. This is followed by Chinese government’s crackdown on the delivery workers’ mutual aid networks, as well as harassment of Mengzhu’s supporters engaged in the solidarity campaign. Any public discussion of Mengzhu’s detention within China has been censored, making it challenging to raise broader awareness within the country. This is why international solidarity is all the more important in keeping the limelight on the arrests as well as the conditions and organizing of Chinese delivery workers.
