This is a call to delivery workers, couriers, logistics workers, and all who want to support the struggle of workers in the delivery and logistics sector—in China and elsewhere: On February 25, 2021, former delivery worker Mengzhu was detained. Mengzhu’s real name is Chen Guojiang. He set up mutual aid networks to support his fellow workers, and he spoke out publicly against the exploitation of delivery workers. On April 2, 2021, Chinese authorities charged him with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” a bogus charge regularly leveled against activists in China. We call on all delivery workers around the world to join the efforts, include solidarity with Mengzhu in their daily actions and struggles, and support our demands. Please, read the whole statement and the demands [here](/mengzhu/2021/05/01/supportmengzhu.html).
